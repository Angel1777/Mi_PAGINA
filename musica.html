                    <h4>I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night <br>
                        Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife<br>
                        And if it was an open-shut case<br>
                        I never would've known from that look on your face<br>
                        Lost in your current like a priceless wine<br>
                        The more that you say<br>
                        The less I know<br>
                        Wherever you stray<br>
                        I follow<br>
                        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
                        Wreck my plans<br>
                        That's my man<br>
                        Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)<br>
                        Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in<br>
                        As if you were a mythical thing<br>
                        Like you were a trophy or a champion ring<br>
                        And there was one prize I'd cheat to win<br>
                        The more that you say<br>
                        The less I know<br>
                        Wherever you stray<br>
                        I follow<br>
                        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
                        Wreck my plans<br>
                        That's my man<br>
                        You know that my train could take you home<br>
                        Anywhere else is hollow<br>
                        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
                        Wreck my plans<br>
                        That's my man<br>
                        Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)<br>
                        They count me out time and time again<br>
                        Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)<br>
                        But I come back stronger than a 90's trend<br>
                        Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark<br>
                        Show me the places where the others gave you scars<br>
                        Now this is an open-shut case<br>
                        Guess I should've known from the look on your face<br>
                        Every bait and switch was a work of art<br>
                        The more that you say<br>
                        The less I know<br>
                        Wherever you stray<br>
                        I follow<br>
                        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
                        Wreck my plans<br>
